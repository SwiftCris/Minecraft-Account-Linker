# Minecraft-Account-Linker

Do you want to link your inventory and location with your java account? well now you can!

Install this plugin if you want for players to link thier accounts to thier java/bedrock accounts

# CAUTION 
if you have **NOT** Linked your account yet, but you have items let's say on Java, please do NOT link on bedrock because , you will loose items, instead link on Java then, when you join on bedrock, your inventory will be linked.

AS OF RIGHT NOW, EVERYONE CAN LINK THIER ACCOUNT WITHOUT NEEDING VERIFICATION SO, UNLESS YOU INTEND ON ADDING THIS PLUGIN ON A SERVER WITH FRIENDS PLEASE DO NOT USE IT. 

THIS WILL BE CHANGED IN A FUTURE UPDATE
